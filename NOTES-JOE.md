**OVERALL**: "I focused on the code structure, modularity, and maintainability of the project. I applied only basic styling, but I made a well-structured styles with variables etc.

My goal was to demonstrate sound development practices, and concentrating too much on styling would have taken time away from showcasing those essential aspects.


**FAST DEV** Environment: I have created a customised CRA, so you can have fast incremental build AND the actual node server

**prettier** I love prettier I put the settings in the package.json

**DRY** I have created a separated NPM for code to use across frontend and backend and for anything worth sharing across projects

**GLOBALS**: I have created a single .env in the back-end. I could have expanded it to have development and production

**SEO**: I have used actual href links

**FILTER**: I created a sample filter for categories with some "cool" styling

**SCRIPTS**: I prefer to keep open 2 CMD and have react and node run separately. I could have use concurrently and a single script but I cannot see properly the console logs
