**OVERALL**: "I focused on the code structure, modularity, and maintainability of the project. I applied only basic styling, but I made a well-structured styles with variables etc.

My goal was to demonstrate sound development practices, and concentrating too much on styling would have taken time away from showcasing those essential aspects.


**FAST DEV** Environment: I have created a customised CRA, so you can have fast incremental build AND the actual node server

**prettier** I love prettier I put the settings in the package.json

**DRY** I have created a separated NPM for code to use across frontend and backend and for anything worth sharing across projects

**GLOBALS**: I have created a single .env in the back-end. I could have expanded it to have development and production

**SEO**: Whenewer possible _I avoid **navigate** et similar_. I use actual href links anywhere I can

**API** I have created mock endpoints in the NODE. Despite this you can see the code is well structured and scalable

**FILTER**: I created a sample filter for categories with some "cool" styling

**SCRIPTS**: I prefer to keep open 2 CMD and have react and node run separately. I could have use concurrently and a single script but I cannot see properly the console logs
I have put in root a dummy **deploy.sh** meznt to run with the shell. **I use the Ubuntu shell on windows**


**REDUX** I have used the latest, so I handle with redux both the API calls and the calls to the state. Here as an example I have added some veriables to the state

**Server Side Rendering** The only missing thing. I am learning and this is a custom project, it would have taken more than 2 hours to make sure node API and next play well together

**I will send on a separate email a sample on how nextJS *should* work**
