prettier -> I love prettier I put the settings in the package.json

OVERALL: "I focused on the code structure, modularity, and maintainability of the project because I believe those are the foundations of a scalable and efficient application. While I applied basic styling, I prioritized building a well-structured codebase that is easy to extend and maintain. In a real-world scenario, styling could be further refined without compromising the integrity of the application. My goal was to demonstrate sound development practices, and concentrating too much on styling would have taken time away from showcasing those essential aspects."


**FAST DEV** Environment: I have created a customised CRA, so you can have fast incremental build and the actual node server


DRY I have created a separated NPM for code to use across frontend and backend and for anything worth sharing across projects

GLOBALS: I have created a single .env in the back-end. I could have expanded it to have development and production
